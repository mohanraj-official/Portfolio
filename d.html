“Leading the QA efforts at Robowaves has been a transformative experience. From crafting over
                        200 detailed test scenarios to automating workflows on Fireflink, I ensured that quality,
                        efficiency, and agility went hand-in-hand. Collaborating on the ThinkDirtyApp, I led my team
                        with clear communication and structured tracking, consistently delivering reliable results
                        within our Agile sprints.”

                        tools, designing
                        clear and structured training content, and preparing real-world case studies. My focus is on
                        delivering
                        practical, hands-on learning experiences that equip students with the skills and confidence to
                        solve data
                        challenges effectively.”
